Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1
-------------------------------------------------------
Question 1: mergesort<br/>
Compute the number of inversions in an array of integers (mergesort based)

Question 2: quicksort<br/>
Compute the total number of comparisons used to sort the given input file by QuickSort

Question 3: minimum cut<br/>
Code up and run the randomized contraction algorithm for the min cut problem and use it on the above graph to compute the min cut.

Question 4: strong connected components<br/>
Code up the algorithm for computing strongly connected components (SCCs), and to run this algorithm on the given graph. 

Question 5: heap-based Dijkstra's shortest path<br/>
Run Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm on a given graph with O(mlog(n)) running time.

Question 6: median maintenance and hashing based 2-sum<br/>
Implement the "Median Maintainence" algorithm.<br/>
Implement a variant of the 2-SUM algorithm in a large data set.
